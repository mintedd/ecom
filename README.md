## Description
Using Express.js Sequelize, create a model that will interact with a MySQL to allow users to retrieve data as needed. This is very beneficial in ECOMMERCE because you can keep track of inventory such as Categories, Products, and Tags. Then you can grab specific data that you need in your database for a more efficient system.
